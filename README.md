# Connor-Sibley-Portfolio

For my final portfolio, I decided to focus on two aspects of my college works: my creative writing/narrative works, and my game/level design works. For my creative writing and narrative works, I included the poems, short stories, branching narrative, and soundscape that I have create for various classes at Pitt. As for my game design works, I included the video game map I created for my own game called "Singularity Protocol." I also included some explaination about the process I went through in planning the layout of the map. In order to more easily differntiate the pages for each set of works, I made each page have a different coloration. This makes it easier to identify more quickly which page the user is one simply based on color scheme. I put a lot of effort as well into designing a user friendly banner that also emphasizes the different color schemes of each page, making navigation much more intuative. This website will act as my portfolio and is used to demonstrate my creative work experience in a way that will be easy for recruiters to navigate.

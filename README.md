# Connor-Sibley-Portfolio

My portfolio will display 2 facets of my creative works I created during my time at Pitt. The first being my creative writing works (poetry, fiction writing, branching narrative, and the soundscape), and the second being my game design work. At the moment, I have all of the html main pages constructed and properly linked to, however they do not as of yet fully contain the works yet. I also plan on entering all of the information on my resume into the Resume section of my portfolio for easy access. I’m also going to add a social links section on the main page, but I don’t plan on dedicating an entire new page to this. I’m still unsure how I will organize the individual works, but I am leaning toward making all of the narrative works have their own pages that will be linked to, whereas all the game design stuff will share one page. The pages containing the creative writing works will have remembering links, so that users will know whether or not they have already read a story or not.

Most of the content is also now implemented into my portfolio. I do have a bit more stuff I would like to incorporate into the Game Design tab, and the buttons on the Narratives tab have not yet been styled. Otherwise most of the important content is already implemented and the overall design of the website in terms of structure and appearence will remain unchanged.

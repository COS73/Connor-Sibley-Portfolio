    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      I am a student at the University of Pittsburgh studying Game Design, seeking a role in the video game industry. Along with studying at Pitt, I am teaching myself Unreal Engine 5. I am currently looking for an internship, and considering co-op opportunities. My degree will be a Bachelors of Science in Digital Narrative and Interactive Design. I am also minoring in Computer Science and Creative Writing, and hoping to minor in Film Studies as well. My expected graduation date is December 2023.

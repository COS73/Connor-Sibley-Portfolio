    <h2>Creative Writing Experience</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      All of this creative writings were written during my time at the University of Pittsburgh, through both my Digital Narrative and Interactive Design major, as well as my Creative Writing minor. While these stories are the final version I submitted for those classes, I believe they can still afford more edits to improve upon them, so I plan on revisiting them in the future. All of the short stories (and some poems) underwent a workshop process during which my professor and my peers reviewed the stories. During these workshops, I also provided other students with constructive critiques.

    <h2>Game Design Experience</h2>
    <p class = "paragraph">
      A lot of my learning experience at Pitt has focused on the narrative aspects of game design, meaning I can write a really good story. Therefore, a little over a month ago, I began teaching myself Unreal Engine 5 with the hopes of creating my own video game. What started as watching tutorials on YouTube and messing around in some of the presets the engine provided, quickly became more serious as I began to feel more comfortable with blueprints and the engine itself. Now I am comfortable with creating my own blueprints, UI elements, actors, and even my own map using the cube grid tools. Even though I have only spent a short amount of time working in Unreal Engine as a side project, I am really happy with how much I have been able to learn on my own. I still have a lot of plans and ideas for my game, including bosses, unique characters, more maps, and complex abilities. I am hoping an internship will give me more opportunity to explore game design first hand as well as gain experience working with game engines in a professional setting.
